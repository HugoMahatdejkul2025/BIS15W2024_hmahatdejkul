```

## Warm-up
1. Load the `bison.csv` data.
2. What are the dimesions and structure of the data?
3. We are only interested in code, sex, weight, year of birth. Restrict the data to these variables and store the dataframe as a new object.
4. Pull out the animals born between 1980-1990.
5. How many male and female bison are represented between 1980-1990?
6. Between 1980-1990, were males or females larger on average?

1.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
bison<- read_csv ("data/bison.csv")
```

2.
```{r}
dim(bison)
glimpse(bison)
summary(bison)
```
